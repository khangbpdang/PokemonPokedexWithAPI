# PokemonPokedexWithAPI
## This is an improvement of the PokemonPokedex Android app in my other repository. In this project, I added the ability to dynamically pull data from **Pok√©API** in the form of JSON and display it in the main menu of the app. The name of the pokemon has to be loaded manually in the code itself in order for the app to display it.
